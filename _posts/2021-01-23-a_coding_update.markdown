2020 threw me (and most other people, I’m sure) for a loop since my last blog post. My new schedule and reality left me with far less time to focus on coding than I’d have liked, even forcing me to take a short break at one point.  During that time, I did my best to fit in videos and podcasts about coding while I did my more mindless tasks at work. Even if I couldn’t pay full attention, it felt better than nothing – maybe repeatedly listening to people talk about programming would result in me at least becoming more familiar with the lingo?

As soon as I had an ounce of more free time, I began inching my way through the JavaScript module and in doing so, I learned how badly I want to find success in this field. I went through personal and professional catastrophes, yet continued to code, even if it meant fitting it in on my lunch break or in the wee hours of the morning. This module has been more challenging than the others and has taught me what a painstakingly slow process it is to become a good coder...if you’re doing it right.

I had a 1:1 with my teacher last night and he explained to me that learning to code is like learning to play an instrument (in this example, a piano).  In order to really perfect the ability to play a piece, one first must play it at a significantly reduced speed. This gives your brain time to pay attention to the placement of your fingers, and your fingers the time to develop the muscle memory of where to go next. Once you’ve got that down, you steadily increase the pace at which you play until you reach the intended speed.  If you jump in too quickly and attempt to start off at the intended speed, you’re more likely to make mistakes (and your brain and fingers commit those mistakes to memory).

Coding is no different. It’s not for the impatient.  Most can’t jump in, learn the syntax, and how to resolve their errors immediately. In fact, receiving an error message is the perfect example of when to take it slow.  You have to consider what the message says: Where does it point to in your code? Why did that part of your code throw an error? Brainstorm reasons. Now how do you resolve it? Google (Stack Overflow, MDN, etc.) should be your best friend(s). And just like playing the piano at a reduced speed, sifting through and reading various online explanations about coding takes up a lot of time. And if you skip this step in search of a quick fix, maybe you’ll find it. But in doing so, you’re losing the chance to fully comprehend your work.  You’re guaranteed to come across the same or a similar error eventually, and the more time you take to slow down and read all about how your code functions, the more quickly you learn to resolve those errors in the future.  

There’s an endless amount to learn when it comes to programming, but I think the most important thing I’ve come to understand is that taking the time to research and read various explanations of how things work is the key to becoming the best coder you can be.
